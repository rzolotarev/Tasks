It's convenient to reasoning from end.

1. To create a list of merged ordered intervals occupied by any person. Because the only thing I 
need to do is to go through each gat between intervals and compare with given interval;
2. To merge I need to collect all ordered occupied interval by both person. The intervals are ordered
by start time. Because to merge it I only need to take the start time and max of end time;
